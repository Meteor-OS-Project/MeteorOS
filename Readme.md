# MeteorOS

## Getting started with the Code

To get started with the code, maybe fork the [repo](https://github.com/Meteor-OS-Project/MeteorOS) to your account! Then, edit away!
Create a custom vendor file with your own vendor files at ```vendor\[your vendor title]```. You will also have to add a vendor option and set it to your
Makefile (in your vendor folder) in ```Makefile```.

## Submitting patches

Submitting patches is a great way to help out! To submit patches, send your new code to your fork and press Contribute and then begin a pull request.
It should be accepted soon after.
